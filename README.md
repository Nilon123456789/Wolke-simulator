# Running the project and building the binaries

The project is a maven java project. You therefore need to have maven and java installed on your machine if you want to run your own version of the project. You can also download the binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/Nilon123456789/Wolke-simulator/releases/latest)

## Running the project
The project is using maven and java 17. You can run the project with the following command:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -D"exec.mainClass=com.e24.wolke.application.AppPrincipale24"
```

## Creating binaries

To create the jar, exacutable binaries and the installer, you can use the following command:

```bash
mvn clean compile package
```
__Nota__ : The installer is created with the [jpackage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/jpackage/jpackage) tool. You need to have the JDK 17 installed on your machine. Also the binary is created for the current OS. If you want to create a binary for another OS, you need to run the command on that OS.

# Development

We are using different pipelines to ensure the code quality and the project stability.

## Pre-commit hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure the code quality. You can install the hooks with the following command:

Windows and Linux

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Test the hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Mac

```bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Test the hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```
