The time step defines the time interval between two iterations. The smaller the time step, the more precise the simulation. However, a small time step increases the computation time. If the time step is too large, the simulation is at risk of becoming highly unstable. If this happens, the physics engine displays a CFL value in the console, which corresponds to the stability of the simulation. The simulation is considered stable as long as the value is less than or equal to 1. Additionally, along with the CFL message, a suggestion for a time step is provided by the physics engine.
