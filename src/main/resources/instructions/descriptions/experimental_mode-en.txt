In the constants file located in the 'wolke' folder within your user directory, it is possible to activate the experimental mode demonstrating the rendering capability of the simulation using OpenGL by changing the value of the constant 'USE_OPENGL_' to 'true'. Note that this feature is highly unstable and is not recommended for production use, where standard rendering with Swing is recommended. This mode remains available to demonstrate the research and learning efforts that have been undertaken to become familiar with GPU rendering technologies using OpenGL. Refer to the 'README.md' file in the 'backend/models/renderer' folder for specific execution details of this mode.
